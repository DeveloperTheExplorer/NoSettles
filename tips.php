<h1>TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<h3>Getting Donations</h3>
<p>NoSettles is made for you to get donations for the things you want, for that reason we are going to provide you with some tips and tricks on how to get donations more often or faster.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Post one thing at a time. While you might be wanting to get the money you want for several things it is best for you to post and focus on one thing at a time rather than many.</li>
  <li>Set reasonable amount of money for your post. If you set the amount incredibly high, it is very unlikely for someone to donate that much.</li>
  <li>Add details and pictures to your post. Pictures are specifically very good for getting attractions and details such as descriptions help the donators to understand why they should donate to you.</li>
  <li>Ask your friends on other social media websites to donate to you. Tell the people that you know to come and join themselves and help you too. This way there would be more donators on the website and since they know you personally they are most likely to help you out with the things that you want. Even if they don't you can just simply ask them to tell the people they know to take a look at your post and hopefully donate to you.</li>
  <li>Help others too. You don't really have to donate to them for helping them you can just spread the word and ask others to donate. This way, you'll be helping out other people and they will probably try to help you too.</li>
  <li>Most importantly, be patient and Don't Settle!</li>
